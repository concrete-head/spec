Go structureless

	Why?
	-

	How?
	- Nodes in a single array
	- Inputs occupy the first x elements
	- Outputs occupy the last y elements
	- Introduce inhibitory connections that reset target node to zero
	- nodes have a value and a value_next property
	- connections generated randomly with different LTPWindows and decays
	- Function that checks for orphaned nodes and resets them


	- Output nodes send some kind of back-pulse to their inputs, stimulating them slightly.



Make CNN

	Why?
	- Just to see how quickly this type of network can learn patterns. e.g. NMIST



Build connections from scratch
	- Faster.
	- When a output node fires, it will build new connections with the pre synaptic nodes if they don't already exist
