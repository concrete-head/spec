Go structureless

	Why?
	- So the network can learn firing order rather than just groupings

	How?
	- All nodes held in a single array where the first (i) nodes are inputs, the last (n) nodes are outputs (read out nodes)
	- Introduce inhibitory nodes that have negative weights
	- nodes have a value and a value_next property
	- connections generated randomly with different learningWindow and decayRate
	Optional
	- Function that checks for orphaned nodes and resets them
	- Output nodes send some kind of back-pulse to their inputs, stimulating them slightly.

Make CNN

	Why?
	- Just to see how quickly this type of network can learn patterns. e.g. NMIST


Optimisation Idea - Build connections from scratch
	How?
	- When a output node fires, it will build new connections with the pre synaptic nodes if they don't already exist
