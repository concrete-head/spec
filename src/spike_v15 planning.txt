v14 was a failed experiment.
Strutureless is too difficult to interpret what is happening (if anything)


New plan

Add recurrent timesteps
i.e. add more inputs and group them into t, t+1, t+2, t+3 etc
why?
- So the network can learn the order of firings
Details:
- Go back to v13 and adapt it to work with characters and sequence (throw out images). Instead of 8192 inputs use say 50 (where each input represents a character) for each group
- Possibly also feed the outputs back into the inputs, but test above method first
